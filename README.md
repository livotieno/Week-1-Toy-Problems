# Week-1-Toy-Problems
The repository contains three challenges towards toy problems hence has three js files that will help in easing the problems.
  # index1.js
  The main aim of creating the toy challenge js file was to create a grading system that would output corresponding student 
  grades. The grading runs from 0-100
  To pull this off I generated a function gradesystem with a parameter that will be used as the argument when the function is 
  invoked.
  Six elements will undergo execution to check the grades of the user.
  If the output exceeds 100 then an error message is displayed hence when the outcome is true the corresponding grades will 
  be logged on the console.
  For you to run the process first you would open the terminal on VsCode and run node Toy1 challenge.js, call the grade 
  system, and enter the marks inside the operator. 

  # index2.js
  For the Toy2 challenge, we are supposed to write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g. 80. If the speed is 
  less than 70, it should print "Ok".
  Otherwise, for every 5km/s above the speed limit(70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total 
  number of demerit points.
     > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points:2".If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".
  To achieve this I created a function speedDetector(), which uses if/else to check whether the speed is less than 70.

  # index3.js
  The solution to this challenge is to write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual's Net Salary by 
  getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
  One should calculate the payee(i.e.Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
