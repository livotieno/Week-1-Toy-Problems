# Week-1-Toy-Problems
The repository contains three challenges towards toy problems hence has three js files that will help in easing the problems.
  # Toy1 challenge.js
  The main aim towards creating the toy challenge js file was to create a grading sysytem that would output corresponding student grades.The grading runs from 0-100
  To pull this of I generated a function gradesystem with a paremeter that will be used as the argument when the function is invoked.
  Six elements will undergo execution to check the grades of the user.
  If the output exceeds 100 then an error message is displayed hence when the outcome is true the corresponding grades will be logged on the console.
  For you to run the process first you would open the terminal on VsCode and run node Toy1 challenge.js

  # Toy2 challenge.js
